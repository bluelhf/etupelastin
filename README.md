# Etupelastin

Etupelastin is the Vite + Svelte front-end for my solution to Reaktor's [PROJECT BIRDNEST](https://assignments.reaktor.com/birdnest/)
assignment. Svelte was chosen because it's very simple and performant, and it's
also the front-end framework I'm most comfortable with. That being said, I'm not
intimately familiar with any front-end development: It's something I've only dabbled in.

Etupelastin is the less interesting part of the project: it just displays JSON data
from the [back-end server that actually solves the assignment](https://github.com/Takapelastin). That being said, it does
have some cool features, and it's still worth checking out :)
